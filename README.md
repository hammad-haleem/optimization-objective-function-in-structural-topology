### Final_Code_for_Compliance.m
This is the final code that compute the compliance, gives complaiance v/s x plots, identify the modalities and also gives percentages of each modality.

### top88.m
This is the Efficient topology optimization top88 code by Erik Andreassen 路 Anders Clausen 路 Mattias Schevenels 路 Boyan S. Lazarov 路 Ole
Sigmund

### Compliance_Calculator.m
This is the user defined function that calculates the compliance of top88 code

### x_calculator.m
This is the user defined function that takes the resultant values of 'x' from top88 code

### x_variables.mat
This is the file that contains the data coming from the X Calculator 

### modalityChecker.m
This is the user defined function that identify between modalities (monotonic, unimodal or multimodal)

### getModalityText.m
This is the user defined function that converts the modality code to text

### isMonotonic.m
This is the user defined function that check whether the result is monotonic

### isUnimodal.m
This is the user defined function that check whether the result is unimodal

### isMultimodal.m
This is the user defined function that check whether the result is multimodal
